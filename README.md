# StuyHacks2021
This a project my group made for StuyHacks 2021, a drawing app that allows you to draw by holding and moving around an object in front of your webcam.
The app works by utilizing tracking.js, a JavaScript library allows you to do color tracking, and various other computer vision tasks, in the browser.
